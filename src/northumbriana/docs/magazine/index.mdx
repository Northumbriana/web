                The magazine was launched in 1975 by its founder, Roland Bibby, its "frenzied editor", scribe, artist, sales distributor and treasurer until his untimely death in January 1997.

Much of the magazine's contents were drawn from writing and composing entries submitted each year to the Morpeth Northumbrian Gathering competitions. These could be poems, prose, essays or plays, written in standard English or Northumbrian dialect. Musical compositions, tunes or songs, found room here.

Pleasingly, children submitted entries of a very high standard. Other articles covered a wide variety of subjects including architecture, traditional tales. folklore, music, archaeology humour, and reminiscences of the former way of life of Northumbnan farmers and fisherfolk. Last, but by no means least, the results of the Dialect Survey to date also appeared.

Most back numbers are still available for purchase from Kim Bibby-Wilson at enquiries@northumbriana.org.uk or by ringing 01670 513308. It’s hoped to digitise the back issues in due course
